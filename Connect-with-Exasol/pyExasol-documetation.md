# PyExasol Documentation

## Question

Where do I find the PyExasol documentation?

## Answer

### Rendered Documentation (User Guide and API Reference)

You can read the rendered documentation at
<https://exasol.github.io/pyexasol/master/index.html>. This website is
the best place to learn how to use PyExasol because it includes the user
guide, examples, and best practices. It is also the right place to look
up the API reference when you need details about functions, parameters,
and return values.

### GitHub Repository (Source Code)

You can visit the GitHub repository at
<https://github.com/exasol/pyexasol>. This page contains the complete
source code, tests, and the project history. You should use it if you
want to understand how something is implemented, report a bug by opening
an issue, contribute changes through a pull request, or review updates
in the releases section and in the changelog, in folder 
[doc/changes/](https://github.com/exasol/pyexasol/tree/master/doc/changes).
