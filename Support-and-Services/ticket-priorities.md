# Which ticket priorities does Exasol use?

When you create a ticket, you should select a priority based on the following criteria:
## Critical (Blocker)

Business-critical processes are no longer available. No quick, temporary solution exists.
Important note: If you have to create a ticket with a critical priority outside of German business hours (CEST time), you must [call our support hotline as well](https://exasol.my.site.com/s/create-new-case?language=en_US).

Examples:

- The connection to the database is not possible, or the database service is not available.
- The database does not start due any disk space issue.
- The database does not start after an update.
- The VPN Tunnel does not function, and a database connection is therefore not possible. 

 
## Major

Important functions and/or access to the database are severely compromised. Working with the database is only possible to a limited extent.

Examples:

- Backup processes lead to a loss of performance.
- Database memory overflow.
- Database requests (Queries) significantly slower after a version update.

## Normal

Does not apply to critical business processes but has an operational impact. No direct impact on the database availability. A temporary solution is possible.

Examples:

- Database requests (Queries) cause an Error, but there is no direct impact on the general availability of the database.
- Rransaction errors.
- A database server error leads to a loss of cluster redundancy.

## Minor

An error that has no or only minimal effects, or other minor disruptions or impairments, product questions.
No impact on business processes.

Examples:

- Planned activities: Migrations, version updates, firmware import.
- Questions regarding products and functions.
- Installations and consulting.
