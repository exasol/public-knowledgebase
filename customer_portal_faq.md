# Customer Portal FAQ

Beginning May 2023, Exasol introduced a Customer Portal to enable an improved communicatoin channel between customers and support.  The Customer Portal allows you to:
- Open, close, and work on cases
- Send messages directly to Exasol
- See an overview of all cases
- Search through cases and knowledgebase articles

## *How do I get access to the portal?*

During the initial rollout and onboardings, all users that are assigned to one of the following service roles are given access to the customer portal:
- MyExasol User Manager
- Incident Manager
- Decision Maker

The MyExasol User Manager can then open a case of type **Service Request**  and the category **Change Contact Roles** in the [Customer Portal](https://exasol.my.site.com/CustomerPortal/). You will need your customer PIN (or MyExasol PIN ) to send the request. If you don't know your PIN, please contact your account manager and they can provide it. 

## *How can I contact Support now?*

You can contact support via email, phone, or online. The Customer Portal is an additional communication channel to support. The below table describes which communication methods you can use to reach us:
| Support Channel | Method | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| Phone | Call one of the following numbers:<br> - Toll America: +1 415 363 5510<br>- Toll Europe/Rest of the World: +49 911 2399 110 | | 
| Customer Portal | Login to the [Portal](https://exasol.my.site.com/CustomerPortal/s/) and create a case | | 
| Email | Send an email to [service@exasol.com](mailto:service@exasol.com) | - The user's email address must be registered at Exasol<br>- Cases created by email are by default "Questions" and are therefore not SLA-relevant |
| Web | Fill out the form [here](https://exasol.my.site.com/s/create-new-case?language=en_US) | - The user's email address must be registered with Exasol |

## *If I open a case in the portal, will I still receive emails?*

Yes! Exasol's responses will appear in the Customer Portal and also be sent as emails.

## *If I open a case in the portal, does all communication happen there?*

When a case is opened from the portal, you can still reply to the case by responding to the emails that Exasol sends. However it is not possible to add people in cc via the portal. 

## *Which cases can I see in the customer portal?*

You can see all cases from your account, including closed cases, since November 2022. Old EXA Tickets from January 2020 - November 2022 will be imported at a later stage and will also be visible in the portal.    

## *Can I see emails from Exasol in the feed on older tickets?*

Emails from older cases can be found in the **Related** Tab under **Emails**.  

## *Can I upload files directly to the case?*

Log files can be uploaded via the Log File Upload URL, and smaller files up to 2GB in size can be uploaded to the Customer Portal directly. The Log File Upload URL is also visible when viewing the Case in the portal. 

## *How do I reset my password?*

On the login page <link>, click the **Forgot your password** button to reset your password. Your username is your email address and can be found on the initial welcome email. If you are already signed in and want to change your password, click your icon in the top-right corner and go to **Settings** > **Account** > **Change Password**.

## *How can I leave feedback on the new Customer Portal?*
