# How to update EXAClusterOS using the command line

## Background

That article guides you through the procedure to update the ClusterOS via the command line.

## Prerequisites

SSH root access to the License Server.

Check the [Update Considerations](https://docs.exasol.com/db/7.1/administration/on-premise/upgrade/update_considerations.htm) before any software update.

## Instructions

1. Copy the update packages (both) to the License Server.

    ```shell
    rsync -avP EXA*.pkg root@{LS_IP}:/tmp/
    ```

    _or_

    ```shell
    scp EXA*.pkg root@{LS_IP}:/tmp/
    ```

2. Make sure **no backup** or **storage recovery** is in progress.
3. Make sure **EXAoperation is running on the License Server**. Check this in the EXAoperation section.
4. Go to the Software section and **remove the obsolete EXASolution version(s)**.
5. [Stop the Database](https://docs.exasol.com/db/7.1/administration/on-premise/manage_database/stop_db.htm).
6. [Stop the Storage Services](https://docs.exasol.com/db/7.1/administration/on-premise/manage_storage/stop_start_storage_service.htm).
7. [Stop the Cluster Services on the data nodes](https://docs.exasol.com/db/7.1/administration/on-premise/nodes/actions_on_nodes.htm).
8. SSH into the LS and create the update directory.

    ```shell
    mkdir /tmp/exasuite_update/
    ```

9. Extract the package.

    ```shell
    tar xf EXAClusterOS-7.1.NN_LS-Update.pkg -C /tmp/exasuite_update/
    ```

10. Start the EXAClusterOS update.

    ```shell
    $COS_DIRECTORY/share/exaoperation/scripts/exaclusteros_update.sh /tmp/exasuite_update/EXAClusterOS-7.1.NN_LS-Update-CentOS-7.5.NNNN_x86_64.tar.gz
    ```

11. Check the EXAopeartion log and look for the start and completion messages.

    ```text
    tail -f /var/log/logd/EXAoperation.log
    [2023-12-07 16:03:29.911675] NOTICE: [Software update] Start update process to EXAClusterOS version 7.1.NN.
    [2023-12-07 16:04:10.064588] NOTICE: [Software update] First part of update process succeeded. Please shutdown databases and nodes and restart license server.
    ```

12. Apply the CentOS security patch update.

    ```shell
    apply_os_security_updates /tmp/EXASOL-7.1-CentOS-7-CumulativeUpdate-YYYYMMDDHHMM.pkg
    ```

    _Note: In case you see a message like this "Dismiss already applied patchlevel YYYYMMDDHHMM", it means there is no update needed, and you can continue the procedure._
13. Reboot the license node.
14. Check the Software tab and confirm the new version was successfully applied.
15. Make sure there is enough space in the root filesystem (`df -h /`). If not, try removing some files to release space.
16. [Reboot the data nodes](https://docs.exasol.com/db/7.1/administration/on-premise/nodes/actions_on_nodes.htm).
17. [Start the Storage Services](https://docs.exasol.com/db/7.1/administration/on-premise/manage_storage/stop_start_storage_service.htm).
18. [Start the Database](https://docs.exasol.com/db/7.1/administration/on-premise/manage_database/start_db.htm).
