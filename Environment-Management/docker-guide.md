# Docker Guide

*Please note that this is an open source project which is not officially supported by Exasol. We will try to help you as much as possible, but can't guarantee anything since this is not an official Exasol product.*

## Background

Exasol can be deployed as a Docker container for testing purposes. Using Docker, you can create and run an Exasol database quickly with a few commands. The underlying architecture for Exasol on Docker is not the same as traditional deployment methods on-premise and in the cloud, and for these reasons, the method of installation and administration is completely different. This guide will serve as your starting point and will link to the various articles and how-to's to install, run, administer, and troubleshoot Exasol on Docker. The list below will be continuously updated, and if you feel some information is missing or would be helpful, you can let us know by commenting on this article.
